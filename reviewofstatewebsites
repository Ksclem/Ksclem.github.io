    <h1>State Website Reviews</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Maryland </h2>
     
    <p>I thought the Maryland website had the best design. It works well on a computer and a phone. The website loads quickly and the menu is very easy to find and navigate. This website was by far the most memorable and the most engaging. The themed red tint and the moving scenary images looked really cutting edge and gave the page a really cohesive aesthetic look throughout. These aspacts didn't take away from the menu bar, which was easy to see and navigate. Overall, this website was fun to look at while still appearing clean and organized and I think sticking with the theme of their state so much is what set it apart.  </p>
    

        <h2>2. Maine</h2>
    <p>I thought Maine looked really good with the photo overlay and a clean, cohesive, and modern looking page. It loaded quickly and looked good on my phone too. I was easily able to find the menu and navigate it and I also liked the boxes with information and how they moved with the page and even had a drop shadow. The chat bubble was noticale but not in the way of anything. I also liked how they incorperated their state flag logo in tghe top corner of the pages. It was an organized and aesthetic website that worked well. </p>

                 <h2>3. Alaska</h2>
    <p>I really liked the background photo of the mountains and I liked the color scheme of blue. The website loaded quickly, but the mobile version didn't show up as nicely, it was more stacked and the design changed a lot so that is was cluttered. The menu is very easy to see and to navigate. The design was cohesive, but also just seemed a bit dated. It looks pretty good but is not super contemporary looking . Alaska is a state with a lot of creative potential that I think could be improved on, but it was a very functional website that was easy to use.</p>

                  <h2>4. Kansas</h2>
    <p>I thought Kansas was just a little bland, with nothing too interesting. There was a lack of color, scenary, and creativity. It loaded quickly though and worked well on my phone. I didn't agree with the choice to place all of the helpful links, services, and updates at the very bottom of the page and leave the menu at the top with so little. People don't always scroll to the very bottom and it could confuse them and take up more time than needed to find so much at the bottom. There was nothing else glaringly wrong with this page, but also nothing else to take note of.  </p>

                  <h2>5. Arkansas</h2>
    <p>This website loaded very slowly for me, on my phone and on my computer. The layout was still alright on a smaller screen though. I thought that the overall design was too crowded, which makes it harder to find what you're looking for. The menu drop downs are way too crowded as well with was too much information at once. I think they went overboard with the small photos and graphics and it makes the website overwhelming. The chat pop-up is also in a bad, distracting place. The theme did not seem cohesive, they kept switching fonts and colors. This was just a not super exciting or well organized website. </p>
