            <p>The season of spring is when the temperatures begin to warm up and flowers start to bloom again. Darcy likes to spend her time in the spring running through the flowers and smelling all of the wonderful scents, Spring is the greenest time of the year and also the time when most animals have their babies. </p>
            
            <p>Darcy likes the season of spring because she is able to be outside longer due to the increase of daylight and the warmer temperatures. She also enjoys walking through any puddle there is. She has a really great sense of smell so the flowers in the spring are a special thing she gets to enjoy each year.  </p>
            
            <p>She is passionate about locating and tracking animals so spring is a great time for Darcy to use her skills. She finds turtle eggs, frogs, baby birds, and more. This is what she looks forward to the most in the springtime.</p>
