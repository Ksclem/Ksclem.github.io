             <img src="summer2.jpg" alt="Summer Activities" class="summer2">
            <p>During the summer, when the days are long and hot, the best thing you can do is go swimming. Darcy loves to swim, she espeically loves to jump into the water off of docks or ledges. Summer is also when you celebrate the 4th of July. Every 4th of July Darcy gets to have a s'more by the campfire.</p>
            
             <p>Darcy really likes to take naps in direct sunlight and is able to do a lot of this in the summer months. She is a great swimmer and will often walk right into the water on her own and swim. She learned to swim as a puppy while visiting Glacier National Park. She likes to swim around and pick things up out of the water. She also likes to stick her face right in the water to smell things. Sometimes she blows bubbles when she does this. </p>
            
             <p>If you want darcy to jump off of the dock you have to throw a stick in for her. Othwerwise she won't jump. She bays a lot before she takes the leap because she is so excited. Unfortunatley, Darcy's large ears don't do well when she swims all the time so in the summer when she's swimming everyday she has to get special ear medicine. This doesn't mean that she doesn't still love summer though.</p>
