            <h2>What to do in the Winter</h2>
             <img src="winter%202.jpg" alt="Winter Activities" class="winter2">
            <p>In the winter the temperatures drop and snow begins to fall. The best way to spend the winter, when you're not inside a warm house next to a fire, is to play in the snow or even go ice skating. Activities in the snow inlcude building snowmen, igloos, or having snowball fights. Darcy's personal favorite snow activity is to wrestle her sisters in the deep snow. She also loves to chase hockey pucks on the ice all winter long.</p>
        
             <p>Darcy also really really likes to roll around in the snow. She does this about twenty times a day if there is snow on the ground. Darcy also really likes when the lake at her house freezes over. When this happens Darcy is allowed to go on walks around the lake without a leash. This is pretty rare for her. It also allows her to reach places she can't normally go when the lake is not solid. This is a main reason she loves the season of winter.</p>
           
             <p>When Darcy is not outside she likes to lay on her bed by the fireplace. Or sitting right in front of it and getting super warm. Darcy also loves Christmas. Each year she gets a large stuffed animal and carries it around until she rips it into pieces.</p>
