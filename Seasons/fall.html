            <p>Fall is the time when the days get a little bit shorter and colder. This is the time to admire the fall foliage and carve pumpkins. Darcy likes to do both of these, but she eats the pumpkins instead. Fall is also the time for Halloween and scary movies or haunted houses. </p>
             
             <p>Usually Darcy is really happy to welcome the cooler temperatures that fall brings. She has a lot of fur and skin and the summers can get a little too hot for her. She is able to do more activities without getting too warm and having to take a break or go for a quick swim. </p>
             
             <p>This is the time of year that Darcy probably spends the most time outside. It's not yet too cold to be out all the time and its not too hot for her either. She enjoys when things are harvested from the garden and she gets to try some of them. Darcy has never really celebrated Halloween because she doesn't have many clothes and no tricker treaters ever come to her house. She lives too far off any main streets. She doesn't mind this because she doesn't really like strangers anyways. </p>
