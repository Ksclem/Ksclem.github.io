            <h2>What Are The Seasons?</h2>
            <p>The four seasons are distinct periods of the year, each characterized by specific weather patterns and daylight hours:

Spring is marked by warming temperatures, budding plants, and blooming flowers. It's often associated with renewal and growth as nature comes back to life after winter.

Summer is characterized by the warmest temperatures, longer days, and abundant sunshine. This season typically features outdoor activities, vacations, and a variety of fruits and vegetables.

Fall is defined by cooler temperatures and the changing colors of leaves. It’s a time for harvest, with crops being collected and preparations for winter beginning.

Winter is the coldest season, often bringing snow and shorter days. It’s a time for hibernation in nature and can be associated with holidays and indoor activities. But how do these changes affect how we live? This is a page about how Darcy adjusts her life in each of the four seasons.</p>
