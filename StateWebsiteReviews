    <p>I think GoDaddy is the best because security is really important and it also has low prices. The speed of the website is also a very important thing because people get frustrated and leave slow websites. I think having 100 websites isn't a priority and having fewer, but faster and cheaper is the best option. They also had good ratings and reviews. i also think the daily backups are very important as well. </p>
