                     <h2>Winner</h2>
    <p>I think GoDaddy is the best because security is really important and it also has low prices. The speed of the website is also a very important thing because people get frustrated and leave slow websites. I think having 100 websites isn't a priority and having fewer, but faster and cheaper is the best option. They also had good ratings and reviews. I also think the daily backups are very important as well. Ultimatley, price is the biggest factor along with ratings, and GoDaddy seems to have the best of each of those things. </p>
